EC2 instances and Availability Zones

Amazon EC2 provides the ability to spread instances across all the Availability Zones in your Regions.

By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you protect your applications from the failure of any single location.

This improves the availability of your workloads in the event of planned or unplanned interruptions.

When configuring instances across Availability Zones, ensure that there is an equal distribution of instances across all the Availability Zones you use.

For example, if you have nine instances and three Availability Zones, you can spread the instances out by putting three instances into each Availability Zone.
If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, then only three instances are impacted.

To ensure that you always have enough instances available and equally spread across the Availability Zones in your Region,
use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

Scaling is defined as the ability to increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application or workload.

Whether you want to modify capacity or guarantee specific numbers of servers are always running, you can do both with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.
