Launch permissions control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.

The owner of an AMI determines its availability by specifying launch permissions. Launch permissions fall into the following three categories.
Public - The owner of the AMI grants launch permissions to all AWS accounts.
Explicit - The owner of the AMI grants launch permissions to specific AWS accounts, organizations, or organizational units.
Implicit - The owner of the AMI has launch permissions for the AMI they own.
