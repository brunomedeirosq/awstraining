Launch templates store launch parameters, so you don't have to specify them every time you launch an instance.

For example, a launch template can contain the AMI ID, instance type, and network settings that you typically use to launch instances.

Launch templates streamline and simplify the launch process.

They reduce the number of steps required to create an instance by capturing all the launch parameters in one resource.

They also simplify the implementation of standards and best practices, help to better manage costs, improve your security posture, and minimize the risk of deployment errors.
