Service Catalog provides you with the means to create and manage catalogs of IT services that your organization approves for AWS.

These IT services include everything from Amazon EC2 AMIs, EC2 instances, storage, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures.

Service Catalog provides central management of commonly deployed IT services.

It helps organizations achieve consistent governance and meet compliance requirements.

End users can deploy only the approved IT services they need that follow the constraints set by your organization.

benefits of using Service Catalog:

- Standardization
Administer and manage approved assets by restricting where the products launch, the type of instance allowed, and many other configuration options.
The result is a standardized landscape for product provisioning for your entire organization.

- Self-Service Discovery and Launch
Users browse listings of products (services or applications) they have access to. Then, they locate the product they want to use and launch it on their own as a provisioned product.

- Fine-grain access control
Administrators assemble portfolios of products from their catalog and add constraints and resource tags to be used at provisioning.
Afterwards, administrators grant access to the portfolio through IAM users and groups.

- Extensibility and Version Control
Administrators can add a product to any number of portfolios and restrict it without creating another copy.
Updating the product to a new version propagates the update to all products in every portfolio that references it.

Administrators and end users work with Service Catalog.

Catalog administrators prepare CloudFormation templates, configure constraints, and manage IAM roles for products to provide advanced resource management.

End users use their credentials to create authorized resources on AWS. Each user type has a set of tasks that are administrative or not administrative in purpose.

Catalog administrators:

- Design a template

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/getstarted-library.html

- Create a portfolio

A portfolio of products provides a consistent way to offer choices to end users.

- Create products

Create a product using your CloudFormation templates. In this step, open the portfolio, and then proceed with specifying the details of the product.
After you create the product, you can view it in the portfolio.
Now, you can manage versions of products instead of recreating them. End users will have access to the versions you specify.

- Add constraints and grant access

Constraints control the ways specific AWS resources are deployed for a product.

You can use them to apply limits to products for governance or cost control.

Granting a user access to a portfolio allows that user to browse the portfolio and launch the products in it.
To control who can view and modify your catalog, apply IAM permissions. You can assign IAM permissions to IAM users, groups, and roles.

- Test end-user experience

Verify the end user can successfully access the end-user console view and launch your product. Sign in to the console as the end user and perform those tasks.

End Users:

- Browse products

You can use the Service Catalog console to see a list of products and provisioned products.

- Select a version

The Product details page displays information about a product, including a description of the product, details about product versions, and support information.
If multiple versions of a product are available, you can decide which version to use when you read the version descriptions. Typically, you should use the latest version of a product.

- Populate details

After selecting your version, provide any necessary parameters for customizing your requested resources. You can provide any required tags for your provisioned product.

- Launch a product

You can launch any product that appears in your Service Catalog products list.
When launching a product, you create a provisioned product, usually an instance of the product, in a CloudFormation stack.
A provisioned product in AWS is one or more cloud resources you manage as a single unit, such as compute instances, databases, or networking components.

- Review outputs

Provisioned products provide information, called outputs, when a product launches.
Outputs usually display URLs, IP addresses, and database connection strings after the provisioned product launches.
Each output has a key, value, and description.





Additional Resources:


Security best practices -> ervice Catalog provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/security-best-practices.html

You can define rules that limit the parameter values that a user enters when launching a product.
These rules are called template constraints because they constrain how the AWS CloudFormation template for the product is deployed.
You use a simple editor to create template constraints, and you apply them to individual products.

ou can limit the access end users have to AWS resources when you attach an IAM policy to a launch role.
You then use AWS Service Catalog to create a launch constraint to use the role when launching the product.

Service Catalog monitoring -> You can monitor your Service Catalog resources using CloudWatch.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/service-catalog-monitoring.html

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Service Catalog and your AWS solutions.
You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs.
Before you start monitoring AWS Service Catalog, you should create a monitoring plan that includes answers to the following questions:

What are your monitoring goals?

What resources will you monitor?

How often will you monitor these resources?

What monitoring tools will you use?

Who will perform the monitoring tasks?

Who should be notified when something goes wrong?

Managing budgets -> You can use AWS Budgets to track your service costs and usage in Service Catalog. You can associate budgets with Service Catalog products and portfolios.

AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/catalogs_budgets.html
