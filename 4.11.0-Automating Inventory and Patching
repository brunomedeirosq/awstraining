AWS inventory service ->

The team needs to identify all the applications running and ensure that they are in use, up to date with patches, and properly licensed.
They want to verify licensing and get rid of any unauthorized applications and any software or tools not approved by their security operations team.

Inventory

Inventory, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, provides visibility into your environment.
Inventory collects metadata from your managed instances and stores it in an S3 bucket.
You can use built-in tools to query the data to determine which instances are running software and configurations required by your software policy.
With Inventory, you can view data from multiple Regions and accounts.

When you configure Inventory, you specify the following:

- The type of metadata to collect
- The managed nodes to collect the data from
- A schedule for metadata collection

These configurations are saved with your AWS account as a State Manager association.
An association is a configuration.

Metadata collection

When you configure inventory collection, you begin by creating the association.
Systems Manager collects the inventory data when the association runs.
If you don't create the association first and attempt to invoke the inventory, the system returns the following error:

The aws:softwareInventory plugin can only be invoked through ssm-associate.

Inventory collects specific types of metadata. To see what it collects, expand each of the following two sections.

- Preconfigured metadata

You can configure Inventory to collect the following types of data:

Applications: Application names, publishers, versions, etc.

AWS components: EC2 driver, agents, versions, etc.

Files: Name, size, version, installed date, modification and last accessed times, etc.

Network configuration: IP address, MAC address, DNS, gateway, subnet mask, etc.

Windows updates: Hotfix ID, installed by, installed date, etc.

Instance details: System name, operating systems (OS) name, OS version, DNS, domain, work group, OS architecture, etc.

Services: Name, display name, status, dependent services, service type, start type, etc.

Tags: Tags assigned to your nodes.

Windows Registry: Registry key path, value name, value type, and value.

Windows roles: Name, display name, path, feature type, installed state, etc.

- Custom metadata

If the preconfigured metadata types collected don't meet your needs, you can create a custom inventory.
A custom inventory is a JSON file with information that you provide.
To assign custom inventory to a node, you can use the Systems Manager PutInventory API operation.
You can also create a custom inventory JSON file and upload it to the node.

When Inventory collects data, it also captures your custom inventory data.
For example, if you run a large data center, you can specify the rack location of each of your servers as custom inventory.
You can view the rack space data when you view other inventory data. Systems Manager supports a maximum of 20 custom inventory types per AWS account.

Example:

{

    "SchemaVersion": "1.0",

    "TypeName": "Custom:RackInformation",

    "Content": {

        "Location": "US-EAST-02.CMH.RACK1",

        "InstalledTime": "2016-01-01T01:01:01Z",

        "vendor": "DELL",

        "Zone" : "BJS12",

        "TimeZone": "UTC-8"

      }

 }

When running Inventory, determine whether to inventory the following:

- All managed nodes in your AWS account
- Individually selected nodes
- Targeted groups of nodes by using tags

Inventory supports searching inventory files on Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems; the Windows Registry; and individual files.
You can collect metadata information about files, including file names, the time files were created, the time files were last modified and accessed, and file sizes.

To start collecting file inventory, specify a file path where you want to perform the inventory.
Also, specify one or more patterns that define the types of files you want to inventory and if the path should be traversed recursively.
Systems Manager inventories all file metadata for files that match the pattern in the specified path.

Example:

{

"Path": string,

"Pattern": array[string],

"Recursive": true,

"DirScanLimit" : number // Optional

}
