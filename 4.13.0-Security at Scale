AWS Secrets Manager

    helps store, manage, and rotate important configuration data, such as credentials, passwords, and license keys.



Parameter Store

Parameter Store provides a secure, managed key-value store.
It's hierarchical based to help store configuration data and secrets management.
A parameter is any piece of data saved in Parameter Store, such as a block of text, a list of names, a password, an AMI ID, or a license key.
You can store parameters as encrypted or unencrypted data.
Encryption is done using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

Use Parameter Store for the following:
- Passwords
- Database strings
- AMI IDs
- License codes as parameter values

Values are stored as plain text or encrypted data.

Secrets Manager

Secrets Manager helps store and manage important configuration data, such as credentials, passwords, and license keys.
For example, applications can request passwords or information from Secrets Manager to connect to other resources, such as databases, to keep these credentials secure.
When turned on, Secrets Manager automatically rotates your passwords and can generate random passwords for you.

Parameter Store is integrated with Secrets Manager for applications or other AWS services to retrieve Secrets Manager secrets or non-security information contained in Parameter Store.
These supported services include Amazon EC2, Lambda, CloudFormation, AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and other Systems Manager capabilities.
Using Parameter Store to reference Secrets Manager secrets, creates a consistent and secure process for using reference data in your code and configuration files.

Parameter Store versus Secrets Manager

Uses AWS KMS for encryption = Uses AWS KMS for encryption
Stores values as a key-value pair = Stores values as a key-value pair
Interacts with CloudFormation to store secrets = Interacts with CloudFormation to store secrets
Stores encrypted or unencrypted data = Stores only encrypted data
Does not rotate secrets = Rotates secret automatically
Has no random password generation = Offers random password generation
Comes at no additional cost = 	Provides a free 30-day trial and then incurs a cost per secret, per month
