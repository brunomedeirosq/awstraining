A managed node is any machine that is configured for use with Systems Manager and has the SSM Agent running.
The SSM Agent is software that runs on EC2 instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines.
SSM Agent makes it possible for Systems Manager to update, manage, and configure these resources.
The agent takes and processes requests from Systems Manager and then runs them exactly as specified in the request.

By default, Systems Manager doesn't have permission to perform actions on your instances.
You can provide instance permissions at the account level using an IAM role or at the instance level using an instance profile.

If your use case permits, we recommend granting access at the account level using the Default Host Management Configuration.

The Default Host Management Configuration empowers Systems Manager to manage your EC2 instances automatically.

After you turn on this setting, all instances that use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) automatically become managed instances.

Using SSM documents

A Systems Manager document (SSM document) defines the actions Systems Manager performs.
SSM document types include Command documents, which are used by the State Manager and Run Command capabilities of AWS Systems Manager.
Other types of SSM documents include Automation runbooks, which are used by the Systems Manager Automation capability.
Systems Manager includes dozens of preconfigured documents you can use by specifying parameters at runtime.
Documents can be expressed in JSON or YAML and include steps and parameters that you specify.

Run Command

With Run Command, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, you can eliminate the need to use bastion hosts, Secure Shell (SSH), or remote PowerShell.
You can automate common administrative tasks and perform one-time configuration changes on your managed nodes.
You can use Run Command from the console, AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs.

The following are examples of when administrators use Run Command:

- Install or bootstrap applications.
- Build a deployment pipeline.
- Capture log files when an instance is removed from an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group.
- Join instances to a Windows domain.

You can also restrict Run Command to only specific managed nodes.
You do this by creating an IAM policy that includes a condition that the user can only run commands on nodes with specific tags.

In this free hands-on tutorial, you learn how to use Systems Manager to remotely run commands on your EC2 instances.

State Manager

A state is defined as the finalized configuration of an instance based on your business needs.

The state includes the operating system version, patches, software, utilities, and agents that make up the finished state of the instance.

State Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, is a scalable configuration management service.

It automates the process of keeping your Amazon EC2 infrastructure in a state you can define.

It sets and maintains the targeted state of configuration for managed nodes and AWS resources in your AWS account.

State Manager helps with compliance and governance to ensure that all instances meet the standards defined for your compliance goals.

The three primary reasons to use State Manager are as follows:

- Auto scaling

State Manager monitors all instances launched in an account either manually or through Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
If an instance comes online from an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, any configurations defined for that instance (through tags or all nodes) are automatically applied.

- Compliance reporting

State Manager standardizes instances for convenient compliance reporting of required states for resources in your account.

- Managing all nodes

State Manager targets all the nodes in an account, so none of the instances are missed.

Association

A State Manager association is a configuration you assign to your AWS resources.
The configuration defines the state you want to maintain on your resources.
For example, an association can specify that antivirus software must be installed and running on a managed node or certain ports must be closed.

An association specifies a schedule for applying the configuration onto the targets.
For example, an association for antivirus software might run once a day on all managed nodes in an AWS account.
If the software isn't installed on a node, the association can instruct State Manager to install it.
If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, the association can instruct State Manager to start the service.


How State Manager works:

- Determine your end state

What do you want your finalized configuration state to look like?
Do you need to guarantee that your managed node is configured with specific applications, such as antivirus or malware applications?
Do you want to automate the process of updating the SSM Agent or other AWS packages, such as AWSPVDriver package?
Do you need to guarantee that specific ports are closed or open?

To get started with State Manager, you determine the state you want to apply to your AWS resources.
This state determines which SSM document you use to create a State Manager association.

- Use a preconfigured SSM document

Systems Manager includes dozens of preconfigured SSM documents you can use to create an association.
Preconfigured documents are ready to perform common tasks, like installing applications, installing and configuring CloudWatch, running Systems Manager automations, and much more.
You can view all SSM documents in the Systems Manager console.

- Create an association

You can create an association by using the Systems Manager console, AWS CLI, AWS Tools for PowerShell, or the Systems Manager API.
When you create an association, you specify the following information:

- A name for the association – For example, you might use name-of-your-workflow.

- Parameters for the SSM document – For example, you can specify the path for the application to install or the script to run on the nodes.

- Targets for the association – For example, you can target managed nodes by specifying tags, choosing individual node IDs, or choosing a group in AWS Resource Groups.
You can also target all managed nodes in the current Region and AWS account.

- A schedule for when or how often to apply the state – For example, you can specify a cron or rate expression.
