An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration required to launch a virtual compute instance.

This information includes the operating system, any preinstalled software, and the configuration files required to run the instance.
An AMI can be very basic, such as containing only the operating system, or as complex as your needs dictate.

To launch a new EC2 instance, you need an AMI. A single AMI can launch multiple identical EC2 instances.
You can use an AMI provided by AWS or by the AWS community or an AMI purchased from the AWS Marketplace.
You can also create your own. You can share, buy, or sell AMIs.

Standardizing your deployed EC2 instances makes daily administration and troubleshooting less complicated.
A standard image, stops unknown applications, agents, utilities, or one-off configurations that might require additional troubleshooting in the event of an unexpected issue.
You can create a set of golden images for the different EC2 instance types and configurations in use.
A golden image is the finalized, approved version of an instance used to create multiple copies of that image.

Pieces of an AMI

An AMI includes the
root volume,
launch permissions,
and a block device mapping.

Bootstrapping, prebaking, and Image Builder are resources to build and automate your AMIs with version control.
Part of the automation process includes how you manage the lifecycle of your AMIs and the data included in them.
