Both AMIs and launch templates contain information to launch an instance, however we can't launch an instance just by specifying an AMI, we need AMI along with other options.

Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard give us the following options:
- instance type
- key pair
- network settings
- configure storage
- advanced details

Using the launch instance wizard is fast and convenient if you are provisioning only a single instance.
However, building hundreds of instances individually is prohibitive because of the time required.
Knowing that many businesses must rapidly deploy multiple images, AWS provides a feature called launch templates.
