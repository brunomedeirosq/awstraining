Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

Amazon SNS is a notification service that provides significant advantages over the complexity of developing custom messaging solutions or the expense of licensed software for systems
that need to be managed and maintained on site.

It runs within Amazonâ€™s proven network infrastructure and data centers, so topics will be available whenever applications need them.
To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple servers and data centers.

Amazon SNS allows applications and end users on different devices to receive notifications via mobile push notifications, HTTP/HTTPS, Email/Email-JSON, SMS or Amazon SQS queues,
or AWS Lambda functions.
