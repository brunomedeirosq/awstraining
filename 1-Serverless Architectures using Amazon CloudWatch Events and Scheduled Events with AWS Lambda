Serverless Architectures using Amazon CloudWatch Events and Scheduled Events with AWS Lambda

Lab overview
This lab demonstrates how to create serverless infrastructure that can monitor your cloud infrastructure and respond to events.
In the first part of this lab, you learn how to use an AWS Lambda function with Amazon CloudWatch Events to react to the creation of an Amazon EC2 instance.
In the second part of this lab, you create an AWS Lambda function that can monitor a website and alert you when it is not responding correctly.

OBJECTIVES
By the end of this lab, you should be able to do the following:

Create an AWS Lambda function
Configure Amazon CloudWatch Events
Configure an Amazon CloudWatch Alarm
Configure Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send notifications
