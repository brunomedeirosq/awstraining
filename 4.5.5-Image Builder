AWS provides resources to automate AMI updates and provide version control for your AMIs.
The first tool to discuss is EC2 Image Builder.

Image Builder is a fully managed AWS service that helps automate the creation, management, and deployment of customized server images.
You maintain ownership of any customized images that Image Builder creates in your account.

With Image Builder, you configure pipelines to automate updates and patching for the images you own.
You can also run non-pipeline commands to create a one-off image with the configuration resources you defined.

Image Builder helps significantly reduce the effort of keeping images up to date and secure by providing a basic interface, built-in automation, and AWS security settings.

When software updates become available, Image Builder automatically produces a new image without requiring users to manually initiate image builds.
AWS offers Image Builder at no cost. It integrates with AWS Organizations and shares AMIs across accounts based on your existing AMI sharing mechanisms.

You use Image Builder with the console, AWS CLI, or APIs. When used with the console, Image Builder provides a step-by-step wizard to guide you through the process.

You can monitor the progress of your image builds and have Amazon CloudWatch Events notify you for troubleshooting and debugging.

Image Builder also generates a recipe file. You can use this file with existing source code version control systems and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for repeatable automation.
When software updates become available, Image Builder automatically produces a new image and distributes it to stipulated Regions after running tests on it.
