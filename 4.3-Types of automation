AWS offers a variety of automation options depending your business goals.

1. Infrastructure automation

With infrastructure automation, you can build infrastructure components with a template that includes all the AWS resources that you want.
Example resources you can include are EC2 instances or Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances.
After you create the template, the infrastructure automation tool takes care of provisioning and configuring the resources for you.
You do not need to individually create and configure resources.
You can replicate the templates across your organization and deploy them in identical infrastructure across AWS Regions and accounts.
Use version-controlled templates for troubleshooting and compliance data.

AWS CloudFormation is the AWS tool for infrastructure automation.


2. Deployment automation

With deployment automation, you use cloud-centered tools to reduce manual efforts, whether through automating applications or using code to reduce manual effort.
The use of automation increases velocity of deployments and decreases technical error caused by manual inputs.

AWS tools include the following:

AWS CodeDeploy
AWS Lambda
AWS CodePipeline
AWS Auto Scaling
AWS Systems Manager

3. Self-healing and Self-monitoring

With self-healing and self-monitoring, the resources make proactive corrections and notifications when resources change.

Monitoring tools and configuration management scripts proactively create alarms and notifications and resolve issues.
For example, when an instance doesn't respond, it is put into an unhealthy state.
The tool deploys a new instance, or your load balancer automatically shifts traffic patterns to a healthy instance and notifies the team of the situation.

AWS tools include the following:

Lambda
AWS Config
Amazon Inspector
AWS CloudTrail
