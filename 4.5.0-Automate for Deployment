4.5-Automate for Deployment

Different deployment strategies

Implementing the right deployment processes is a critical part of a complete, well-functioning automation solution.
The deployment processes you choose depend on your necessary balance of control, speed, cost, risk tolerance, and other factors.

Prebaking and bootstrapping

An average quick launch of a basic EC2 instance takes roughly 5 minutes.
When provisioned, the process requires additional time for installing patches, applications, utilities, and any customizations to be configured.
This additional time to install components is called provisioning lag.

For workloads that rely heavily on customizing or deploying applications onto EC2 instances,
you can optimize your deployment time through bootstrapping and prebaking practices.
