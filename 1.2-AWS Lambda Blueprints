AWS Lambda Blueprints

Blueprints are sample configurations of event sources and Lambda functions that do minimal processing for you.

Most blueprints process events from specific event sources, such as Amazon S3 or DynamoDB.
For example, if you select an s3-get-object blueprint,
it provides sample code that processes an object-created event published by Amazon S3 that Lambda receives as parameter.

When you create a new AWS Lambda function, you can use a blueprint that best aligns with your scenario.
You can then customize the blueprint as needed.
You do not have to use a blueprint (you can author a Lambda function and configure an event source separately).
