The hybrid method incorporates the use of both bootstrapping and prebaking to make your processes and deployments faster.

With a hybrid of bootstrapping and prebaking, you improve performance by installing the applications ahead of time.
You also keep the flexibility to customize as needed using user data.

1-Launch a base instance
Launch a base EC2 instance as you normally would.

2-Prebake the instance but do not configure it
Install the patches, applications, and agents, but do not configure the application or add customer or vendor-specific information.
This step prebakes a generic version of your software onto the base operating system.
It differs from prebaking in that you do not include any configuration information.

3-Create an AMI
Next, create an AMI containing the prebaked applications.
This instance has all the software and dependencies preinstalled, but none of the applications are configured.

4-Bootstrap the instance
Now, use the prebaked AMI and add a user data script to run at the launch of the AMI to configure it with customized information.
This essentially bootstraps the information when the instance launches.
