When you need to make changes to a stack's settings or change its resources, you update the stack instead of deleting it and creating a new stack.
For example, in your VPC that has an EC2 instance, you can update the stack to change the instance's AMI ID.
When you update a stack, you submit the AMI ID change. CloudFormation compares the changes you submit with the current state of your stack and updates only the AMI ID.
It leaves the other VPC resources unchanged.

When you submit an update, CloudFormation uses one of the following update behaviors:

Update with no interruption:

The resource is updated without disruption.

Update with some interruption:

You can expect some interruption with the resource, which can mean intermittent availability of the resource.

Replacement:

CloudFormation recreates the resource. The replacement is created first.
Any dependencies are updated to the replacement.
CloudFormation deletes the old resource as the last step.

CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks:

direct update or change sets.

When you directly update a stack, CloudFormation immediately deploys your changes that you submit. Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates.
Direct updates can cause interruptions to your target AWS resources.

The preferred method for updating risk-averse stacks is change sets.

CloudFormation change sets

Change sets provide you the option to preview how proposed changes to a stack might impact your running resources.
Whether your changes delete or replace any critical resources, CloudFormation makes the changes to your stack only when you decide to deploy the change set.
You can submit any amount of change sets you need before deploying the change to your stack.
You create and manage change sets by using the CloudFormation console, AWS CLI, or the CloudFormation API.
