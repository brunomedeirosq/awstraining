Image Builder generates new images based on events, such as each time there is a pending update.
This can include source AMI updates, security updates, updates to compliance, or new tests, for example.
Image Builder also generates images based on a specific build cadence.
A build cadence is a set sequence at which new golden images are produced with the latest changes by applying pending changes.

You can test the latest images with Image Builder to validate your applications on the updated builds.
You can also subscribe to notifications from Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) queues for pending updates to images built with Image Builder.
You can use these notifications as events to build new images.
