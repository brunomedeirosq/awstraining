The root volume is one or more Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots.

The root volume of an instance is either an EBS volume or an instance store volume.
For instance store-backed AMIs, you need a template for the root volume of the instance
(for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).

When you launch an instance, we create a root volume for the instance. The root volume contains the image used to boot the instance.
Each instance has a single root volume. You can add storage volumes to your instances when you launch them or after they are running.

You can launch an instance from either an instance store-backed AMI or an Amazon EBS-backed AMI.

We recommend that you use AMIs backed by Amazon EBS, because these instances launch faster and use persistent storage.

Storage for the root device:

All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance store.

Amazon EBS-backed AMI – The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.

Amazon instance store-backed AMI – The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.

Amazon EBS-backed instances:

Instances that use Amazon EBS for the root volume automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached. When you launch an Amazon EBS-backed instance,
we create an Amazon EBS volume for each Amazon EBS snapshot referenced by the AMI you use. You can optionally use other Amazon EBS volumes or instance store volumes,
depending on the instance type.
An Amazon EBS-backed instance can be stopped and later restarted without affecting data stored in the attached volumes.
There are various instance– and volume-related tasks you can do when an Amazon EBS-backed instance is in a stopped state.
For example, you can modify the properties of the instance, change its size, or update the kernel it is using,
or you can attach your root volume to a different running instance for debugging or any other purpose. For more information, see Amazon EBS volumes. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volumes.html

Instance store-backed instances:

Instances that use instance stores for the root volume automatically have one or more instance store volumes available,
with one volume serving as the root volume. When an instance is launched, the image that is used to boot the instance is copied to the root volume.
Note that you can optionally use additional instance store volumes, depending on the instance type.
Any data on the instance store volumes persists as long as the instance is running,
but this data is deleted when the instance is terminated (instance store-backed instances do not support the Stop action) or if it fails (such as if an underlying drive has issues).
