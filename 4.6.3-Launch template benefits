Implementing a launch template helps you do the following:

- Streamline and simplify the launch process.
- Reduce the number of steps required to create an instance by capturing all the launch parameters in one resource.
- Simplify implementation of standards and best practices.
- Manage costs better.
- Improve your security posture.
- Minimize the risk of deployment errors.

Adding a template configuration repository

Amazon EC2 launch templates support the use of Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, for AMIs.

With Parameter Store, you can enter configuration data, such as AMI IDs, license codes, and even account IDs and passwords, into a secure central location.

This simplifies automation and reduces misconfiguration by eliminating the need to specify this information each time you create an instance.

Parameter Store is covered in more detail later in this course.
