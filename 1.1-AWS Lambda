AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

You can upload your code to AWS Lambda and the service can run the code on your behalf using AWS infrastructure.

AWS Lambda supports multiple coding languages: Node.js, Java, or Python.

After you upload your code and create a Lambda function, AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code.

In this lab, you use AWS Lambda as an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to changes to data in and SNS topic and an Amazon S3 bucket.

You can use AWS Lambda in two ways:

- As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events, such as uploading image files as youâ€™ll see in this lab.

- As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls.
