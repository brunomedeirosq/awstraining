For each launch template, you can create one or more numbered launch template versions.
Each version can have different launch parameters. When you launch an instance from a launch template, you can use any version of the launch template.
If you do not specify a version, the default version is used. You can set any of your launch template versions as the default version.
However, if no default version is specified, the first version of the launch template is used.
