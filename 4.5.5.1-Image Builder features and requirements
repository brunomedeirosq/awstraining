Image Builder features and requirements

- Version Control:

Image Builder provides version control for convenient revision management.
It integrates with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) and Organizations to share automation scripts, recipes, and images across AWS accounts.
Image Builder also helps information security and information technology (IT) teams better enforce policies and compliance on images.

- Image Pipeline:

A pipeline needs at least an Image Recipe and an Infrastructure Configuration.

The Image Recipe is a versioned resource that contains a Parent Image AND one or more Components to build your image.

An image pipeline provides an automation framework for building secure AMIs and container images on AWS.
The Image Builder image pipeline is associated with an image recipe or container recipe that defines the build, validation, and test phases for an image build lifecycle.
An image pipeline can be associated with an infrastructure configuration that defines where your image is built.
You can define attributes, such as instance type, subnets, security groups, logging, and other infrastructure-related configurations.
You can also associate your image pipeline with a distribution configuration to define how you want to deploy your image.

- Built-in validation support:

With Image Builder, you can validate your images with AWS tests and your own tests before using them in production.
Doing so reduces errors found in images normally caused by insufficient testing that leads to downtime.

You can set policies that deploy the images to specific Regions only after they pass tests that you specify.

- Supported operating systems:

Image Builder supports the following operating systems:

Amazon Linux 2023
Amazon Linux 2
Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, and 22.04 LTS
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and 8
CentOS Stream 8
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SUSE) 12 and 15

- Prerequisites

- Image Builder uses a service-linked role to grant permissions to other AWS services on your behalf.
You don't need to manually create a service-linked role.
When you create your first Image Builder resource in the console, AWS CLI, or AWS API, Image Builder creates the service-linked role for you.

- The instances Image Builder uses to build images and run tests must have access to the Systems Manager service.
    Here are some Systems Manager requirements:
        - For Amazon EC2 for Linux instances, Image Builder installs the AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) on the build instance if it is not already present.
        Image Builder removes it before creating the image.

        - Image Builder does not install the SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 for Windows Server build instances.
        If your base image does not come preinstalled with the SSM Agent, you must launch an instance from your source image.
        Then, manually install Systems Manager on the instance and create a new base image from your instance.
